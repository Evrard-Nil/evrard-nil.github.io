# Predictive AI in banking environment
*May-June 2018*


*S2E is a french company specialized in the domain of employee saving plans. During my 3 month internship, I worked with the Information Systems Department to build an AI model in charge of helping to better anticipate risky and capacity period.*

Maintaining an infrastructure up and running can be difficult at multiple levels, especially when you are working for large banking companies like 'Société Général' or 'Axa' being especially demanding towards its subcontractor when it comes to availability. 
One of the main issue was to keep the site up and running while dealing with a large amount of user. Because of the way saving plans are working, most users connects at the same time.

My job was to design and implement different Artificial Intelligence models in order to provide more information about expected website traffic to Information Systems Department.

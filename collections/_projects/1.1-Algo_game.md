Algo Game is a little game I built using Flutter. Goal is to introduce basic knowledge of algorithm to players by solving path finding problems.

It shows users how to user sequencing, loops, recursion and some more advanced concept like tail call.

I use Github as a store for levels, this way I can update them without having to update the version on the playstore. It has been a fun project to run and I will keep updating the app in the future.

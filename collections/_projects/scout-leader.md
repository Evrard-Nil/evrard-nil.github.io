I have been a scout leader for 2 years. It really has been an incredible experience for me. I learned a lot about leadership, management and dedication.

My role was to organise week-ends during the year for a group of 6 to 8 scouts. Organisation includes planning, communication, activities and a lot more. Each summer, there was a camp lasting for about 2 to 3 weeks. What I learned about being a scout leader, and more generally a leader, is that it is hard, and even more when things start to go wrong. And what is great with scouting is that things go wrong all the time. 

This role was the first time I had such responsibilities and of course it did not work well immediately. It took me time to understand how I could motivate younger scouts and drive the team during games and activities. Of course I was not suddenly alone to manage the team, my chief was able to help if I needed help and older leaders were able to advise me. I understood how important it was to listen to your team, because I am ambitious I always wanted to do great activities, but in this state of mind you easily forget to check that everybody is as motivated as you and so realize too late that the activity you planned will not be as awesome as you expected or that your team will not be as committed as you are. After a while I was able to involve my team in projects and then it has been way easier...

As a scout, I participated to the Eurojam, an international scouting jamboree with more than 12 000 scouts, from 20 countries, during 12 days. It has been an incredible experience where we met with a lot of amazing people coming from everywhere in Europe.
